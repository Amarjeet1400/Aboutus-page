              such name that caters for the inquisitive minds. Quenching the
              thirst of curiosity the team aims at making solar cars. The saga
              of coup and its journey weaves back in the year 2009. Since than
              the team has fluttered the institution's flag wherever it went.
              The progress leaves no stone unturned as year 2012, 2014 and 2015
              witnessed marvellous feats clinched by the team. In year 2016,
              team stood 14th in Indo Asian Solar Challenge among 195 teams.
